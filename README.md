# ðŸ“„ README â€“ Java Lambdas and Streams Exercises (Ex1â€“Ex8)
## ðŸ§© Ex1 â€“ Filter strings containing 'o'
FilterWith0.java â€“ Filters a list of strings, keeping only those that contain the letter 'o'.

Main.java â€“ Creates a list of strings, applies the filter, and prints the result.

## ðŸ§© Ex2 â€“ Filter strings with 'o' and more than 5 letters
FilterWith0AndLength.java â€“ Filters strings that contain 'o' and have a length greater than 5.

Main.java â€“ Same structure: list, filter, and print.

## ðŸ§© Ex3 â€“ Print months using lambda
PrintWithLambda.java â€“ Prints all elements of a list using a lambda expression.

Main.java â€“ Creates a list of months and uses the lambda-based print method.

## ðŸ§© Ex4 â€“ Print months using method reference
PrintWithMethodReference.java â€“ Uses method reference (System.out::println) to print list items.

Main.java â€“ Creates the same month list and prints using the method reference.

## ðŸ§© Ex5 â€“ Functional interface returning Pi value
PiValue.java â€“ Functional interface with a method getPiValue() returning a double.

Main.java â€“ Implements the interface with a lambda returning 3.1415, then prints it.

## ðŸ§© Ex6 â€“ Sort strings from shortest to longest
SortShortestToLongest.java â€“ Sorts a list of strings by increasing length using lambda and comparator.

Main.java â€“ Passes a list to the sorter and prints the result.

## ðŸ§© Ex7 â€“ Sort strings from longest to shortest
SortLongestToShortest.java â€“ Sorts the same list of strings by decreasing length.

Main.java â€“ Calls the reverse sorter and prints the result.

## ðŸ§© Ex8 â€“ Reverse string using lambda and functional interface
Reverse.java â€“ Functional interface with a method reverse(String) that returns a reversed string.

Main.java â€“ Implements the interface using a lambda, reverses a word, and prints both original and reversed versions.
